## User Guide


## Problem & Scope Statements

Organisations frequently encounter inefficiencies in managing their IT Supprt estates, often leading to reduced productivy, delayed resolutions and employee disatisfaction. Traditional methods for IT support, generally consisting of email chains and excel spreadsheets, present a range of limitations for organisations, lacking transparency, scalability and automation. According to Serrano et al. (2021), many organisation continue to struggle and fail in the adoption of mondernised IT service management practices, highlihting challenges such as inconsitent processes, minimal automation and poor visibility to IT processes. 

This application aims to address these issues through providing a centralised platorm for submiting, resolving and monitoring the progress of IT support tickets. The system is tailored to be a lightweight and intuative solution for automating ticket resolution workflows without the need for a traditional suite of office tools. As such, the scope of this project focusses on secure user authenication, role-based access controls, ticket creation and management, and finally ticket status tracking. Beyond this, Admin users can perform full Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on Tickets and User Accounts, while regular users cannot delete tickets nor see other user data. 

Finally, the system adheres to SOLID principles and leverages database design featues such as soft delete to maxamise the robustness of the system.
